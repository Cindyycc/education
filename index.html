      Attended Queen Elizabeth Sr Public school. I was in the Arts Program where we specialized in the 4 major arts: Visual Arts, Drama, Dance, and Music. This meant wew= would more art classes than the mainstream studets, missing out on a gym and french class. This program required a 2 part audition: a written and in-person to determine our qualification.
